## Node.js: Simple counter

### Usage

Host `index.html` with any server and open it in your browser.

Open rempl-server page in you browser ([http://localhost:8177/](http://localhost:8177/) by default) and choose `web-input`-publisher.

The value is receiving from web page-publisher and displays to the UI. Just change the input value in the publisher and look at the UI.

### How it works

Subscribing to the publisher data and displaying received counter value. Publisher is publishing the data every time when input-field value is changed.
